# Getting Started with Medha Student Information System (SIS)
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Staging site
https://sis-new.medha.org.in/

## Pre-requisites
Install [NodeJS and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
1. node v14.x.x
2. npm v6.x.x

## Local setup
In the project directory, you can run:

1. Install the project dependencies.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

2. Set up `.env` file using `.env.example` and update the environment variables.
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3. Run the app in the development mode.
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

4. For testing, launch the test runner.
    ```sh
    npm test
    ```
    Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


## Staging & Production
1. Install the project dependencies.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

2. Set up `.env` file using `.env.example` and update the environment variables.
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3. Build the app for production.
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
    Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
